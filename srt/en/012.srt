1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,200
Place the front and back side seams right
sides together and fold along the

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,960
finished line to create a crease.

3
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,760
Pin the markings for the armholes
and hem with basting stitches.

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,320
Pin the centre to ensure the
front and back panels lie flat,

5
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,800
Then, at its centre, you insert
a pin as part of the procedure.

6
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,560
As with the back seam, place one stitch at
the hem stand, turn back one stitch at the

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,520
hem peak, and sew
according to the markings.

8
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,920
Once you have stitched up to the
eighth notch, take a deep breath.

9
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,080
For the body's eight-hole
fastening, take one stitch smaller.

10
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,640
We will implement a
backflow prevention measure.

11
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,520
Press the seam flat with a flat iron to
remove any creases, then fold the seam

12
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,520
allowance 2mm onto the front panel.

13
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,120
From the hem to 4 centimetres
below the side seam

14
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,080
Place the basting pin 5 millimetres
to the outside of the seam.

15
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,360
Open the back panel.

16
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,760
Crease it with your fingertips.

17
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,440
I'll give you a hand.

18
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,760
Fold the top edge to
the mark as indicated.

19
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,960
Next, bring out the front side.

20
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,840
Three millimetres outside the side seam.

21
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,600
At 3-centimetre intervals.

22
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Bring the needle through the
fold allowance on the back piece.

23
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,280
Press and stitch down to 4
centimetres below the hemline.

24
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,680
The fold line of the back panel was pinned
in place within a

25
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,760
2-millimetre fold allowance.

26
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Next, to prevent the seam allowance from
catching, use the iron to smooth

27
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,880
out the edges of the body opening.

28
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,880
Turn the body right side out.

29
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,560
Fold the eight-fold section as indicated.

30
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,800
5 centimetres above the sleeve attachment
point, sleeve attachment seam allowance 5

31
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,640
Fold the millimetre markings, and this
time fold along the natural diagonal.

32
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,480
Continue selling 5
millimetres up to Katayama.

33
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
I will insert the pins.

34
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,760
Similarly, we shall offer 5
millimetres on the opposite side.

35
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,560
The intimidating mouth is as marked.

36
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Turn it over and re-pin the right side.

37
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,680
At this point, lower the tension on
the Katayama while inserting the pin.

38
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,040
Place pins on the opposite
side in the same manner.

39
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,400
Next, lay the side seam flat on the table,
smooth out the seam allowance, and

40
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,160
open the armhole without gathering.

41
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,800
Pin the hem in place.

42
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,960
The side seam allowance is attached to the
body with a flat seam, ending at the

43
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,680
shoulder seam and the lower
part of the sleeve attachment.

44
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,480
One stitch must be made on the Katayama.

45
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,520
The hem is applied up to 6 centimetres
from the edge, but the hemline is

46
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,800
positioned 5 millimetres
inwards from the cut edge.

47
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,400
Secure the thread, then stitch every 6
centimetres, followed by attaching

48
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,000
the ears at 3-centimetre intervals.

49
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,120
At this point, secure the position
approximately 2 to 3

50
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,880
millimetres inside the ear.

51
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,200
When the thread runs out midway,
join the ends with a slipknot.

52
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,000
Hold the end of thread A in your left
hand, and with your right hand take the

53
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,600
connecting end of thread B,
passing it under thread A.

54
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,000
Cross them over, form a loop with the B
thread, placing the B thread end

55
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,960
below and the A thread tip above.

56
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,600
Pass the end of thread A through
the loop and hold it in place.

57
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,280
Tighten the thread and tie it off.
