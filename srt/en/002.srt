1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,640
Next is the body.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,440
How to place the front panel on the table.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,680
Place the triangular thread markings on
the sleeve cap side right sides

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,840
together, overlapping left and right.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,360
Through the fabric grain of the Katayama
cloth, secure a pin at

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,600
the edge of the ear.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,240
Align the two selvedges on the back seam
side of both the front

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,960
and back panels neatly.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,880
Place the ruler on the front piece
and lay the back piece on top of it.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,600
When removing the Katayama ruler, gently
pull it out while applying slight pressure

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,880
to prevent the two halves from
shifting out of alignment.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,960
I shall mark the sacred site's seal;
measure the right edge and the

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,960
centre—three points in
total—and it shall be complete.

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,280
Please note the dimensions including
an additional 2 centimetres at the hem.

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,280
The hem is trimmed and finished
with a continuous seam.

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,680
Please note the hem
allowance is 2 centimetres.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,880
External 23cm.

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
Note: 15 cm body length.

19
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,760
Next, the width mark.

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,320
First, mark 1 cm seam allowances at
approximately 20 cm

21
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,040
intervals down to the hem.

22
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,560
The width mark is added from the seam
allowance, plus the back width

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,720
and 0.4 cm of seam allowance,

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Mark from the hem to the side seam.

25
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,560
At this point, the back width is narrow,
and the difference between the

26
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,400
shoulder width and the back width is

27
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,600
For those over 3 centimetres, the
measurement shall be

28
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,040
taken to the collar base.

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Record a shoulder width increase
of 0.4 centimetres at Katayama.

30
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,280
Tie the katayama and
miyatsuguchi diagonally.

31
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,000
Mark the mountain fold on
the sleeve attachment side.

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,200
Next, mark a 9-centimetre collar opening
on the back piece, 2 centimetres

33
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,240
behind the side seam from Katayama.

34
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,160
At the break of dawn,
I set my waiting pins.

35
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,880
I will.

36
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,120
Do not cut all the way to the front panel.

37
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,360
Insert cardboard between
the front and back panels.

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,920
Insert the scissors.

39
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,920
At this point, take care
not to cut too much.

40
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,880
This completes the marking
for the back panel.

41
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Next, lift the two pieces of fabric for
the back panel to reveal the front panel.

42
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,520
Reapply the side and hem markings
securely, ensuring they

43
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,600
align with the back panel.

44
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,440
Mark 23 centimetres on the side
where the lapel is attached.

45
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,800
At this position, mark 8 centimetres from
the right edge for those with a thick

46
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,960
chest and 9 centimetres
for those who are slender.

47
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,920
For those of average build,
mark 8.5 centimetres.

48
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,560
Measure the distance from the
hem mark to the collar base.

49
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,360
The front width measurement mark is
positioned towards the

50
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
front from the side mark.

51
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,800
Add 0.4 cm to the width and mark up to
the position of the captain's collar.

52
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,360
Next, connect the underlap position and
the collar-under dimension

53
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,640
position diagonally.

54
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,680
Next, mark the collar and shoulder area.

55
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,240
At the collar shoulder point, first
measure 3 centimetres from the ear tip,

56
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,200
Lightly mark 3 centimetres from the edge.

57
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,680
From the edge of the ear to 3
centimetres is 2 centimetres.

58
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,640
Mark 1.5 cm at a point
3 cm below the stop.

59
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,520
Mark a 0.3 cm point at the stop.

60
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,440
At the shoulder, 9.6 centimetres.

61
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,960
It ties with a beautiful curve.

62
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,960
At the underarm drop position, tie the 0.2
cm seam allowance above

63
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,680
the mark to the mark piece.

64
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,280
This completes the markings
around the collar and shoulders.

65
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,680
Intended for the centre back, with
the underlap positioned at the ro.

66
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,720
In this manner, the tape measure is
positioned to ensure accurate measurement.

67
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,360
This completes the marking
for the front panel.
