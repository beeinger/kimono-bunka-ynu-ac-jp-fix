00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.840
Insert a cotton muslin interlining
into the neckline facing at the back.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.320
Honour. Combining the centre of the Ishin
with the collar, place the collar flat on

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.120
the fabric from the centre of
the collar to the left and right.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.600
Place the collar seam and the raw
edge together and secure with pins.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.640
Stitch flat with 2-centimetre
intervals between stitches.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.400
Spread the collar fabric flat from the
shoulder seam to the tip of the collar.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.720
At this point, take care to ensure there
are no creases in the collar cloth.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.840
Place the collar, the collar stand, the
front edge seam allowance, and the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.360
front panel seam allowance on top.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.120
A slackness will form in the front panel,
centred around the tip of the blade, so

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.600
ensure it is fully stretched out here.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.280
Fold the collar width
to the finished width.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.320
Then apply the iron.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.640
At this point, take
care not to stretch it.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.480
Through the fabric at the collar tip.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.720
Attaching the collar. Fold the undercollar
over the seam allowance by 2

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.680
millimetres and secure with pins.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.240
Pin the collar in place with a dress pin,
securing the collar shoulder opening

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.760
position and the tip position.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.080
Secure the middle section with a pin.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.840
Do the same for the left half.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.760
Next, fasten the collar points.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.920
The collar edge is folded straight along
the finished grain line to set the crease.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.560
Secure with a single
strand of sewing thread.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.600
Bring the needle out from
the fold at the front collar.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.200
Along the folded edge beneath the collar.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.520
When you fold down the
collar side's fold line.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.000
Scoop towards the three collar points.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.880
Return to the front
collar's seam allowance.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.320
Join the end of the thread.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.680
Adjust to a length of 2 centimetres.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.560
Twist the thread tightly to prevent the
knot from loosening, then join the two

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.880
strands together and twist
them in the opposite direction.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.920
Pull the collar seam allowance out from
the stitching side to

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.240
reveal the inner collar.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.960
Fold the front collar seam allowance and
pin it in place; spread out the back

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.120
collar seam allowance and pin it in place.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.840
Sew 5 millimetres from the fold.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.840
Backstitch from the first
stitch to the second.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.440
I will stop the ball.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.040
Fold the collar seam allowance
towards the inner side of the collar.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.440
Pull up the collar seam
allowance diagonally like this.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.600
Ensure the seam allowance does
not fold over to the AREA.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.360
Enclose the collar seam allowance
with the undercollar and close it.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.280
At this point, take care to ensure
no stitches show on the front collar.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.280
Bring out the front collar.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.880
The collar points are trimmed
to match the hairline.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.600
Attach the back collar to the neckline
seam with a 2-millimetre

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.280
overlap, securing it with pins.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.640
Bring the needle up one stitch above
the collar tip on the back collar.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.320
The seam on the collar attachment side and
the underside of the

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.600
collar are folded over.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.680
Sew the inside edge with 6mm stitches.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.400
Take care to sew so that no white
stitches show on the front collar.
