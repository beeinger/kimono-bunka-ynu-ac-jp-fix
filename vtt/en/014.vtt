00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.840
Place the front panel right side up and
spread it out, then layer the facing

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.320
with the right sides together.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.480
Marking the fold lines on the
lapels makes them easier to sew.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.120
Pin the hem edge of the facing seam
allowance, matching the 2cm allowance.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.080
Align the underlap of the body with the
tip of the underlap and pin them together.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.560
Pin the collar points together.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.800
Furthermore, pin each
section at the midpoint.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.280
Begin sewing the facing by threading the
needle through the hemline

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.080
cut edge, then at the hem peak

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.040
Using a needle, make one backstitch, sew
to the edge of the lapel,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.560
and take a thread break.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.800
After backstitching, sewing back along the
seam will make it stiff, so sew up at a

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.520
45-degree angle and secure with a knot.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.400
Place the flat iron on the seam.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.960
Place the iron 2 millimetres
from the back right edge.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.680
Take care to ensure that excessive
gathering does not occur at the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.240
collar-under measurement position.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.920
Thus, a 2-millimetre
allowance was applied.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.680
Turn it over.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.640
To attach the ear flaps to the lapels.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.880
Pin the facing fabric
flat with straight pins.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.640
Attaching the ear 1 from the diagonal
mark on the lapel attachment.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.360
Mark the ear holes from 3 centimetres
above the hem to 6

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.040
centimetres above the hem.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.720
The hem stopper should be positioned
within the white hem allowance.
