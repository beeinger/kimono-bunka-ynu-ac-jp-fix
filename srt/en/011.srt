1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,960
Bleaching. Prepare twice the length of the
cotton fabric, plus 2 centimetres for the

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,880
shoulder width. Apply a serger
stitch to the cut edges.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,600
Fold the shoulder pad lengthwise
in half and widthwise in half.

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,640
Pin the shoulder seam allowance at 7.8 cm.

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,360
I'll insert the scissors.

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,080
Widen the width and cut the
opening on the front side.

7
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,280
Place the iron on the centre back of the
shoulder pad, then align the body and

8
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,280
shoulder pad fabric at the
shoulder seam and autumn cut edge.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,960
The seam allowance and
the basting stitches.

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,240
Align the centre back
of the shoulder pads.

11
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,840
Pin the fabric flat.

12
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,960
Place shoulder pads 2 centimetres
apart, 1 millimetre outside the seam.

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,960
Bring the needle out through
the fabric and close it.

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,200
The stock is threaded twice.

15
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,440
Sew only the seam allowances
of the body diagonally.

16
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,720
At this stage, use white lower
thread No. 30 for the binding thread.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,480
Lay the body and shoulder pads flat with
the seams open, align the cut edges of the

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,200
collar and shoulder openings,
and secure with pins.

19
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,200
The shoulder pad sits 1.2 centimetres
inwards from the edge

20
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,160
of the body's side seam.

21
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,160
The finishing of the collar shoulder area
and sleeve attachment line is carried out

22
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,160
in the same manner as
for the vertical fabric.
