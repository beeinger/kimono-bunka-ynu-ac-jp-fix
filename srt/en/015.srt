1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,120
Look at the hem of the front.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,760
Please take care not to
let the skirt ride up.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,240
Turn the hem inside out.

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,240
Fold the hem back 2 centimetres and press.

5
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,760
Apply a 1-centimetre fold iron at
half the length of the hem allowance.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,200
Fold it into thirds.

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,200
The corner of the toe.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,600
A pin in the finished piece.

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,280
We pinned the front side at 1 point 5 cm.

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,840
Fold the corners diagonally with the iron.

11
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,040
I will arrange it neatly in the frame.

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,640
Hold the stem at its base, gripping the
three corners of the stem's white section.

13
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,320
Remove the needle from the tip angle.

14
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,720
Sew the hem, collar-edge
hem and three-needle stitch.

15
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,560
Insert the needle into the
inner corner of the frame.

16
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,600
Turn the fabric 180 degrees.

17
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,400
Sew the seam allowance of the outer fabric
and the undercollar in a single stitch.

18
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
This is called a return kick.

19
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,160
Return the needle to the white corner at
the hem and stitch at

20
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,600
1-centimetre intervals.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,640
At this point, also bring the needle
stitching out at the

22
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,760
right edge of the lapel.

23
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,720
With the hem allowance 2mm short of the
edge, remove the needle and turn the hem

24
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,920
allowance 180 degrees towards the
opposite side before stitching it back.

25
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,520
In this manner, within each
2-millimetre ridge, a ridge is formed.

26
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,440
I'll make sure to stitch it
securely so it doesn't come apart.

27
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,360
Finish off the toe by turning back and
knitting to the end, then work the slanted

28
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,960
section over 3 stitches, bringing
the needle out at the toe corner.

29
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,360
Small knots were tied.

30
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,000
I will.

31
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,160
This bead stopper should be drawn into the
yellowish-white section

32
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,760
so that it remains hidden.

33
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,280
I will cut the thread.

34
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,400
The hemming is now complete.

35
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,600
Thus, within each 2-millimetre
ridge, the ridge must not collapse.

36
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,080
I'll make sure the stitches
are clearly visible.
