00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.960
Bleaching. Prepare twice the length of the
cotton fabric, plus 2 centimetres for the

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.880
shoulder width. Apply a serger
stitch to the cut edges.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.600
Fold the shoulder pad lengthwise
in half and widthwise in half.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.640
Pin the shoulder seam allowance at 7.8 cm.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.360
I'll insert the scissors.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.080
Widen the width and cut the
opening on the front side.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.280
Place the iron on the centre back of the
shoulder pad, then align the body and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.280
shoulder pad fabric at the
shoulder seam and autumn cut edge.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.960
The seam allowance and
the basting stitches.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.240
Align the centre back
of the shoulder pads.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.840
Pin the fabric flat.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.960
Place shoulder pads 2 centimetres
apart, 1 millimetre outside the seam.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.960
Bring the needle out through
the fabric and close it.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.200
The stock is threaded twice.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.440
Sew only the seam allowances
of the body diagonally.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.720
At this stage, use white lower
thread No. 30 for the binding thread.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.480
Lay the body and shoulder pads flat with
the seams open, align the cut edges of the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.200
collar and shoulder openings,
and secure with pins.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.200
The shoulder pad sits 1.2 centimetres
inwards from the edge

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.160
of the body's side seam.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.160
The finishing of the collar shoulder area
and sleeve attachment line is carried out

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
in the same manner as
for the vertical fabric.
