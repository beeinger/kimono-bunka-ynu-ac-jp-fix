00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.800
Before attaching the collar, ensure the
matching marks on the body

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.480
and collar are aligned.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.120
After attaching the collar,
crease it down to 1 centimetre.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.960
Place the right side of the body facing
outwards, and secure with a pin from

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.040
the centre back towards the right front.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.200
Place the collar inside-out against the
body, aligning the collar peak with the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.520
back seam's seam allowance,
and pin in place.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.960
Align the 4 cm mark and pin flat 2 2

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.320
Align the 8.2 cm mark on the collar with
the 8 cm mark on the body and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.520
secure with a mountain-pointed pin.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.440
For collars 2 and 3, allow the collar
fabric to be 2 millimetres

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.880
slack around the shoulder area.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.200
Slip your left hand beneath
the bodice and curve it.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.640
When opening the carving, use four pins.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.560
At this point, the seam allowance should
be 3 millimetres shallower

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.720
than the cut edge.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.960
Place a pin between 2 and 4.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.560
Next, align the markings for the underlap
position and secure with six pins.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.120
Stretch taut between 3 and
6 and place a pin at 7.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.280
Next, 10.1 cm and 10 centimetres
from the tip of the blade.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.480
Align the matching marks
below and insert eight pins.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.560
Place the lining on the table
and turn up the collar cloth.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.800
Pull it diagonally all the
way to the tip of the blade.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.120
At the collar tip and undercollar
fold, place 9 pins at a shallow angle.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.040
Place a 5cm flat 20 pin
5cm from the collar edge.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:34.000
Next, gather the lapel 6mm between
pins 8 and 10 and secure with pins.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.400
Pin the lapel edge in place, then stretch
the lapel's seam allowance (dimension

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.320
1) taut and secure it with pins.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.240
Pull the front edge diagonally leftwards
until the collar facing and front edge

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.160
collar attachment dimensions
lie flat, then secure with pins.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.040
Pin the collar fabric along
the collar attachment line.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.280
While removing it from the frame, I
re-pin the fabric with straight pins.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.360
Pick up one stitch at the
collar edge with a crochet hook.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.600
I shall stop.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.640
Form a loop at the end of the thread.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.720
Pull the needle up from beneath the hoop.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.840
We will tighten it securely.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.320
Sew with a 2.5 cm hem.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.680
Continue sewing up to 2 centimetres
from the tip of the blade.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.200
Remove the needle and allow the
thread to breathe sufficiently.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.200
Sew with a 2.5 cm hem.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.120
Raise the pin at point 6 so the fabric
does not slip, and attach the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.400
collar to the lapel up to this pin.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.040
Beyond this point lies the inner cape.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.000
Remove the seam allowance and
attach the collar to the body.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.640
Remove the stitches around the collar and
shoulders, then sew with two small

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.040
needles in a backstitch pattern.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.680
Sew two small stitches around
the collar and shoulder area.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.760
Remove the needle up to the back seam
allowance, take a thread breath, and make

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.360
one reverse stitch at the centre back.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.960
Sew the left side in the same manner,
securing with basting stitches.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.680
Finish the stitching with a slip stitch,
then backstitch 1 to 2 stitches

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.160
and secure with a knot.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.760
Apply a flat iron to
the seam of the collar.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.000
The seam allowance is 1mm, folded towards
the facing and pressed

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.640
with a pressing iron.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.320
Adjust the collar and smooth the crease.
