1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,480
Align the cut edges of the collar opening
and secure with pins, then align the cut

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,040
edges of the hem opening
and hold in place with pins.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,600
Carefully stretch the fabric taut with
pins, then secure the centre with a pin

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,800
to ensure both sides of the body lie flat.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,480
Furthermore, in the centre of that, we
proceed to pin it in place

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,040
using the pinning method.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,320
Begin sewing by backstitching one stitch
from 4 millimetres above the

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,000
three-fold seam allowance.

9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,280
Once you have sewn to the hem, remove the
needle and allow the thread

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,080
to breathe for a good while.

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,880
At the hem, turn with a small needle.

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,120
Sew up to the hem's standing edge.

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,440
Thread the needle and sew
back along the cut edge.

14
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
I will stop the ball.

15
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,240
Leave the shoulder pad attachment
area unstitched when double-stitching.

16
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,440
Sew from a point 2 to 3 millimetres
inside the ear to the base of the ear.

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,880
Press a flat iron along the
seam to remove any creases.

18
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,400
Next, the back seam.

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,200
Fold the white fabric
2mm to the left side.
