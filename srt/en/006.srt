1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,560
I shall now sew the sleeves.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,560
Turn the cuff inside out and
spread it out towards you.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,400
As sleeves become difficult to fold once
sewn into a circle, it is

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,840
advisable to sew the sleeves first.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,160
Before putting them on, fold the
cuffs over three times first.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,240
This is the cuff.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,320
Place the folding iron against
the 6-millimetre seam allowance.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,880
Open this 6 millimetre gap and
fold half of it, 3 millimetres.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,880
Furthermore, the finished product
is a 3-millimetre tri-fold.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,080
I'll place the folding iron here.

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,360
On the outer surface, a shallow
stitch is applied under the sleeve.

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,800
Pin the seam allowance at the cross of the
underarm and cuff, then pin the swing

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,880
allowance and underarm cross together.

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,360
Place a pin 3 millimetres from the cut
edge at the 1.5-fold position

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
of the pattern allowance.

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,160
Place a pin 2 centimetres from the rounded
sleeve edge and sew this

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,800
section with shallow stitches.

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,920
Before sewing, measure the approximate
dimensions and thread the

19
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,760
needle to avoid wastage.

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,160
Sew a shallow stitch 3
millimetres from the edge.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,040
Begin and end your
stitching with a backstitch.

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Fold the iron with a
2-millimetre seam allowance.

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,960
The sections not to be basted
should be turned up at an angle.

24
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,400
Turn it over and adjust
it to match the tweezers.

25
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,960
In this manner, the seam is concealed
within the 2 millimetres

26
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,280
of the Kise mountain.

27
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,360
The basting stitches stop at the cuff.

28
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,400
A pin at the midpoint of the
rounded mark below the cuff.

29
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,440
Pin the sleeve width and sleeve
length together at the cross.

30
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Place a pin at the mark for the sleeve cap
curve, and another pin at the

31
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,120
midpoint of the sleeve width.

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,720
To begin sewing the hem, pass the
thread through the edge of the fabric.

33
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,880
Once you've sewn up to the rounded
sleeve, do the finishing stitches.

34
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,840
Backstitch one small stitch.

35
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,520
Sew the rounded sections with a needle.

36
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
I'll just pop over briefly.

37
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,200
Finish the curve with a backstitch.

38
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,920
Sew up to the cuff stop.

39
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,720
I shall perform the ritual
of offering incense.

40
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,600
At the cuff, turn back one stitch smaller.

41
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
Scoop diagonally to stop.

42
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,800
Open the cuff.

43
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,080
Ensure the thread is securely fastened.

44
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,440
Sew back 2 centimetres.

45
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,240
I will stop the ball.
