1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,680
Next is the marking of the lapel.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,040
First, thread the fabric
through the hem opening.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,160
Place the front facing fabric with its
pattern matched facing downwards, with the

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,920
left and right facings
right sides together.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,400
Align the hem and the underside of the
collar, both cut through the

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,200
grain, and sew them together.

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,000
First, I shall record the severing from
the cut edge, noting both

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,320
civil and military affairs.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,200
Next, mark 2 centimetres
for the foot allowance.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,640
Mark the collar-to-hem measurement from
the 2-centimetre hem allowance, noting it

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,280
on the facing and the
underside of the collar.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,760
Add a 1.5 cm seam
allowance at the neckline.

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:31,280
From this 1.5 cm mark, mark the width of
the lapel plus 0.2 cm

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,680
towards the inner side.

15
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,600
Measure the seam allowance for the
underlap at the collar-under

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,520
dimension position.

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,320
Add 2.5 cm to that measurement and mark
the hem allowance of

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,920
0.3 cm at the hem edge.

19
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,680
The hem of the lining is
fastened to the collar base.

20
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,120
Mark the 0.3 cm point at the front edge
and connect it diagonally

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,000
to the collar base position.

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,480
Measure precisely from the collar edge at
the top to the hem at the bottom

23
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,520
and make a note of the measurements.

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,600
This completes the marking of the lapel.
