Marking the collar.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.560
Fold the collar fabric in half with the
grain running through the collar

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.000
peak, right sides together.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.840
Align the raw edge of the collar
attachment side and sew

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.040
the fabric together.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.800
First, mark the measurement from point I
to point R on the body

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.760
piece, plus 0.3 centimetres.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.560
Measure 0.5 centimetres
from the edge of the lapel.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.960
The collar length mark is also indicated
on the back side with the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.200
grain running straight.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.400
I shall add further detailed annotations.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
4 cm from the collar peak.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.760
Mark 10.1 centimetres from the
8.2 cm hemline drop position.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.760
Next, mark a 1-centimetre collar
allowance to the tip of the collar.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:11.480
The collar width is marked by adding 0.1
centimetres to twice the collar width.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.960
Collar point: 15.1 cm Front drop: 13 cm

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.320
Mark the 11-centimetre
measurement from the collar stand.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.840
Tie the collar 4 centimetres
below and the underlap diagonally.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.200

The facing, like the collar, is folded in
half with the right sides together,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.680
passing the grain line
through to the facing area.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.600

paper and make a mountain fold.

centimetres along the grain of the fabric.
