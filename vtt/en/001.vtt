00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.160
I shall now proceed to apply the markings
to the Oodate women's

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.400
single-length kimono.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.760
This is where the pattern is matched and
thread marks are made

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.320
at the canvas joints.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.360
First, we begin with the sleeves.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.800
Thread marks are applied in this manner on
the sleeve attachment

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.240
side of the sleeve cap.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.760
Fold in half with the right sides together
through the grain of the sleeve cap.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.880
Place the sleeve attachment
side facing towards you.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.360
Fold the other piece in the same way,
with the right sides facing, into two.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.880
Place the left and right sleeves on top of
each other with the cuff

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.920
ends facing upwards.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.200
For the sleeve cap, prepare two pieces,
and for the cuff, prepare four pieces.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.560
Lightly secure with a pin.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.320
Trim the underarm seam allowance, but mark
2 centimetres added to the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.200
sleeve length at three points.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.800
Place the ruler at these three points,
perform the perspective cut, and sever.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.600
Marking begins with the bamboo stamp,
adding 0.2 centimetres for seam allowance

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.240
to the sleeve length and
noting this at four points.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.760
Cuff measurement: 23 cm.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.680
External dimensions: 23 centimetres.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.280
Mark the seam allowance
of 0.5 cm below the cuff.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.600
Note the cuff allowance
of 0.6 centimetres.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.200
Next, at the sleeve cap, add 0
points and 2 cm to the sleeve width.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.240
Here too, add 0.2 centimetres
to the sleeve width.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.600
At the sleeve attachment point 1, mark
the sleeve width plus 0.3 centimetres.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.040
Below the cuff, mark the sleeve
width plus 0.1 centimetres.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.040
Mark the sleeve width plus 0.1 cm; this
point where the sleeve length and sleeve

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.000
width intersect becomes the cross mark.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.840
Mark a diagonal fold line on
the sleeve attachment side.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.320
Sleeve roundness
measurement at cuff, bottom.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.680
and attach to the underarm.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.240
Next, position the curved template
according to the curvature dimensions and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.560
trace the curve using
an investment spatula.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.120
I shall also mark the centre of the curve.
