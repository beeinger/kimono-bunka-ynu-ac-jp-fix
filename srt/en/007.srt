1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,240
Mark the curved hem allowance by turning
out the back sleeve and marking

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,640
three points 5mm above the curve.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,320
Place the rounded mould and
make a straight spatula.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,360
Mark another centimetre higher.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,800
Apply the rounded mould and
perform the investment process.

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,120
At this point, the underarm is marked from
the position of the curve, and the cuff

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,560
side is marked up to where
it meets the edge of the ear.

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,280
The finishing of the curves shall be
done with two strands of sewing thread.

9
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,280
Sew with a 5-millimetre stitch.

10
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,640
However, sew back along the outer and
inner needles, aligning them,

11
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,760
1 millimetre from the edge.

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,720
At this point, allow a 4 to 5 centimetre
slack to make it easier

13
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,360
to tighten the thread.

14
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,320
For the second piece, sew with stitches
aligned as for the first piece, then

15
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
sew back 1 millimetre from the edge.

16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,000
Place the front outer side facing upwards,
and apply a 2-millimetre

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
allowance to the underarm.

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,560
Leave a 1-millimetre seam allowance
on the front sleeve below the cuff.

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,320
Position the rounded shoulder
1mm in front of the rounded seam.

20
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,280
Enclose within the seam allowance
and secure with a basting stitch.

21
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,080
Pull the tightening thread
from the outer thread.

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,800
A 1-millimetre gap will be left.

23
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,160
Next, tighten the thread
that has been sewn back.

24
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,760
Similarly with the second thread.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,880
Pull the fabric taut, gathering
it towards the centre.

26
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,120
Use the curling iron to shape the hair
into a rounded form without any sharp

27
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,600
angles, and flatten the tucks slightly.

28
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,240
Once the curve is even, secure the thread
used for shaping the curve with a knot.

29
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,680
Remove the rounded mould
and turn it inside out.

30
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,120
The underarm curve is trimmed to a
1-millimetre allowance, while the underarm

31
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,320
is trimmed to a 2-millimetre allowance and
finished with a hair-pinning technique.
