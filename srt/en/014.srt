1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,840
Place the front panel right side up and
spread it out, then layer the facing

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,320
with the right sides together.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,480
Marking the fold lines on the
lapels makes them easier to sew.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,120
Pin the hem edge of the facing seam
allowance, matching the 2cm allowance.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,080
Align the underlap of the body with the
tip of the underlap and pin them together.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,560
Pin the collar points together.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,800
Furthermore, pin each
section at the midpoint.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,280
Begin sewing the facing by threading the
needle through the hemline

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,080
cut edge, then at the hem peak

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,040
Using a needle, make one backstitch, sew
to the edge of the lapel,

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,560
and take a thread break.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,800
After backstitching, sewing back along the
seam will make it stiff, so sew up at a

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,520
45-degree angle and secure with a knot.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,400
Place the flat iron on the seam.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,960
Place the iron 2 millimetres
from the back right edge.

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,680
Take care to ensure that excessive
gathering does not occur at the

17
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,240
collar-under measurement position.

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,920
Thus, a 2-millimetre
allowance was applied.

19
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,680
Turn it over.

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,640
To attach the ear flaps to the lapels.

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,880
Pin the facing fabric
flat with straight pins.

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
Attaching the ear 1 from the diagonal
mark on the lapel attachment.

23
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,360
Mark the ear holes from 3 centimetres
above the hem to 6

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,040
centimetres above the hem.

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,720
The hem stopper should be positioned
within the white hem allowance.
