1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:06,840
Insert a cotton muslin interlining
into the neckline facing at the back.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,320
Honour. Combining the centre of the Ishin
with the collar, place the collar flat on

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,120
the fabric from the centre of
the collar to the left and right.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,600
Place the collar seam and the raw
edge together and secure with pins.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,640
Stitch flat with 2-centimetre
intervals between stitches.

6
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,400
Spread the collar fabric flat from the
shoulder seam to the tip of the collar.

7
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,720
At this point, take care to ensure there
are no creases in the collar cloth.

8
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,840
Place the collar, the collar stand, the
front edge seam allowance, and the

9
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,360
front panel seam allowance on top.

10
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,120
A slackness will form in the front panel,
centred around the tip of the blade, so

11
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,600
ensure it is fully stretched out here.

12
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,280
Fold the collar width
to the finished width.

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,320
Then apply the iron.

14
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,640
At this point, take
care not to stretch it.

15
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,480
Through the fabric at the collar tip.

16
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,720
Attaching the collar. Fold the undercollar
over the seam allowance by 2

17
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,680
millimetres and secure with pins.

18
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,240
Pin the collar in place with a dress pin,
securing the collar shoulder opening

19
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,760
position and the tip position.

20
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,080
Secure the middle section with a pin.

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,840
Do the same for the left half.

22
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,760
Next, fasten the collar points.

23
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,920
The collar edge is folded straight along
the finished grain line to set the crease.

24
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,560
Secure with a single
strand of sewing thread.

25
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,600
Bring the needle out from
the fold at the front collar.

26
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,200
Along the folded edge beneath the collar.

27
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,520
When you fold down the
collar side's fold line.

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,000
Scoop towards the three collar points.

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,880
Return to the front
collar's seam allowance.

30
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,320
Join the end of the thread.

31
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,680
Adjust to a length of 2 centimetres.

32
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,560
Twist the thread tightly to prevent the
knot from loosening, then join the two

33
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,880
strands together and twist
them in the opposite direction.

34
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,920
Pull the collar seam allowance out from
the stitching side to

35
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,240
reveal the inner collar.

36
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,960
Fold the front collar seam allowance and
pin it in place; spread out the back

37
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,120
collar seam allowance and pin it in place.

38
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,840
Sew 5 millimetres from the fold.

39
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,840
Backstitch from the first
stitch to the second.

40
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,440
I will stop the ball.

41
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,040
Fold the collar seam allowance
towards the inner side of the collar.

42
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,440
Pull up the collar seam
allowance diagonally like this.

43
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,600
Ensure the seam allowance does
not fold over to the AREA.

44
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,360
Enclose the collar seam allowance
with the undercollar and close it.

45
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,280
At this point, take care to ensure
no stitches show on the front collar.

46
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,280
Bring out the front collar.

47
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,880
The collar points are trimmed
to match the hairline.

48
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,600
Attach the back collar to the neckline
seam with a 2-millimetre

49
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,280
overlap, securing it with pins.

50
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,640
Bring the needle up one stitch above
the collar tip on the back collar.

51
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,320
The seam on the collar attachment side and
the underside of the

52
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,600
collar are folded over.

53
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,680
Sew the inside edge with 6mm stitches.

54
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,400
Take care to sew so that no white
stitches show on the front collar.
