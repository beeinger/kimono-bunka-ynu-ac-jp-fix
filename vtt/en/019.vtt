00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.880
Ensure the left and right sleeves are not
mixed up, and verify the sleeve attachment

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.520
measurements on the body and
the sleeve from the front.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.840
Wrap the sleeves within the body piece
and align them right sides together.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560
Examine the sleeve fabric
and attach the sleeve.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.680
Pin the sleeve cap to the
side seam of the body.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.880
Well.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.720
Next, align the sleeve attachment
points and secure them with pins.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.240
At this point, pin the body piece
to the folded mountain edge.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.840
Place a pin 5 centimetres above the sleeve
attachment point, aligned with

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.320
the 5-millimetre seam allowance.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.880
Continue to place pins at 5cm intervals.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.720
Similarly, place a pin at
the beginning of the month.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.560
Sleeve attachment. First, remove the
basting pins and use a small needle

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.600
to take a small horizontal stitch.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.520
I shall stop.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.480
Next, we perform the scoop stop.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.760
When starting to attach,
sew with a 2.5 cm hem.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.240
Sew up to one stitch before
the end and remove the needle.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.760
Sew the outer mountain with a
three-and-a-half-stitch backstitch.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.800
Sew the other side in the same manner,
then remove the needle 2cm from the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.240
end and sew back along the same path.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.560
The sleeve attachment shall
be secured with a slip stitch.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.400
That completes the external connection.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.640
In this manner, the body side
is stitched with shallow folds.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.480
Place the flat iron on the outside.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.480
A 2-millimetre restriction will
be applied to the sleeve side.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.560
Turn up the sleeves.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.440
Trim the 2mm ridge and
finish with a finishing tool.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.480
Next, fold the lower edge of
the kuke-dai as indicated.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.760
At this point, please take care to include
the seam allowance under the

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.520
sleeve within the front sleeve.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.240
Turn the swing side out and neaten
the sleeve attachment seam allowance.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.720
First, attach three pin tacks
centred on the sleeve cap.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.200
Next, pin the underarm gusset in
place to prevent it from bunching up.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.400
Pin the sleeve to the sleeve stop.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.880
Next, attach the ear 3
centimetres above the sleeve stop.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.680
Attach one stitch to
the sleeve hem as well.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.080
Furthermore, within the 2mm seam allowance
at the underarm, the needle stitches

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.560
for the ear hair are visible.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.960
In this manner, secure one stitch within
the 2mm seam allowance

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.560
of the underarm yoke.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.120
The finishing iron is used to shape the
rounded underarm area of the furisode

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.960
sleeves, and to adjust the
cuffs and the kise mountain.
