00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.640
Next is the body.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.440
How to place the front panel on the table.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.680
Place the triangular thread markings on
the sleeve cap side right sides

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.840
together, overlapping left and right.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.360
Through the fabric grain of the Katayama
cloth, secure a pin at

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.600
the edge of the ear.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.240
Align the two selvedges on the back seam
side of both the front

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.960
and back panels neatly.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.880
Place the ruler on the front piece
and lay the back piece on top of it.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.600
When removing the Katayama ruler, gently
pull it out while applying slight pressure

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.880
to prevent the two halves from
shifting out of alignment.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.960
I shall mark the sacred site's seal;
measure the right edge and the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
centre—three points in
total—and it shall be complete.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.280
Please note the dimensions including
an additional 2 centimetres at the hem.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.280
The hem is trimmed and finished
with a continuous seam.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.680
Please note the hem
allowance is 2 centimetres.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.880
External 23cm.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.680
Note: 15 cm body length.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.760
Next, the width mark.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.320
First, mark 1 cm seam allowances at
approximately 20 cm

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.040
intervals down to the hem.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.560
The width mark is added from the seam
allowance, plus the back width

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.720
and 0.4 cm of seam allowance,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.920
Mark from the hem to the side seam.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.560
At this point, the back width is narrow,
and the difference between the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.400
shoulder width and the back width is

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.600
For those over 3 centimetres, the
measurement shall be

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.040
taken to the collar base.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.400
Record a shoulder width increase
of 0.4 centimetres at Katayama.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.280
Tie the katayama and
miyatsuguchi diagonally.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.000
Mark the mountain fold on
the sleeve attachment side.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.200
Next, mark a 9-centimetre collar opening
on the back piece, 2 centimetres

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.240
behind the side seam from Katayama.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.160
At the break of dawn,
I set my waiting pins.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.880
I will.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.120
Do not cut all the way to the front panel.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.360
Insert cardboard between
the front and back panels.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.920
Insert the scissors.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.920
At this point, take care
not to cut too much.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.880
This completes the marking
for the back panel.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.600
Next, lift the two pieces of fabric for
the back panel to reveal the front panel.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.520
Reapply the side and hem markings
securely, ensuring they

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.600
align with the back panel.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.440
Mark 23 centimetres on the side
where the lapel is attached.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.800
At this position, mark 8 centimetres from
the right edge for those with a thick

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.960
chest and 9 centimetres
for those who are slender.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.920
For those of average build,
mark 8.5 centimetres.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.560
Measure the distance from the
hem mark to the collar base.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.360
The front width measurement mark is
positioned towards the

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.120
front from the side mark.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.800
Add 0.4 cm to the width and mark up to
the position of the captain's collar.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.360
Next, connect the underlap position and
the collar-under dimension

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.640
position diagonally.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.680
Next, mark the collar and shoulder area.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.240
At the collar shoulder point, first
measure 3 centimetres from the ear tip,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.200
Lightly mark 3 centimetres from the edge.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.680
From the edge of the ear to 3
centimetres is 2 centimetres.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.640
Mark 1.5 cm at a point
3 cm below the stop.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.520
Mark a 0.3 cm point at the stop.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.440
At the shoulder, 9.6 centimetres.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.960
It ties with a beautiful curve.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.960
At the underarm drop position, tie the 0.2
cm seam allowance above

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.680
the mark to the mark piece.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.280
This completes the markings
around the collar and shoulders.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.680
Intended for the centre back, with
the underlap positioned at the ro.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.720
In this manner, the tape measure is
positioned to ensure accurate measurement.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.360
This completes the marking
for the front panel.
