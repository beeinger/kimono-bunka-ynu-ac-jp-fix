00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.120
Look at the hem of the front.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.760
Please take care not to
let the skirt ride up.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.240
Turn the hem inside out.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.240
Fold the hem back 2 centimetres and press.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.760
Apply a 1-centimetre fold iron at
half the length of the hem allowance.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.200
Fold it into thirds.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.200
The corner of the toe.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.600
A pin in the finished piece.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.280
We pinned the front side at 1 point 5 cm.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.840
Fold the corners diagonally with the iron.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.040
I will arrange it neatly in the frame.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.640
Hold the stem at its base, gripping the
three corners of the stem's white section.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.320
Remove the needle from the tip angle.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.720
Sew the hem, collar-edge
hem and three-needle stitch.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.560
Insert the needle into the
inner corner of the frame.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.600
Turn the fabric 180 degrees.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.400
Sew the seam allowance of the outer fabric
and the undercollar in a single stitch.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.680
This is called a return kick.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.160
Return the needle to the white corner at
the hem and stitch at

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.600
1-centimetre intervals.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.640
At this point, also bring the needle
stitching out at the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.760
right edge of the lapel.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.720
With the hem allowance 2mm short of the
edge, remove the needle and turn the hem

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.920
allowance 180 degrees towards the
opposite side before stitching it back.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.520
In this manner, within each
2-millimetre ridge, a ridge is formed.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.440
I'll make sure to stitch it
securely so it doesn't come apart.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.360
Finish off the toe by turning back and
knitting to the end, then work the slanted

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.960
section over 3 stitches, bringing
the needle out at the toe corner.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.360
Small knots were tied.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.000
I will.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.160
This bead stopper should be drawn into the
yellowish-white section

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.760
so that it remains hidden.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.280
I will cut the thread.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.400
The hemming is now complete.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.600
Thus, within each 2-millimetre
ridge, the ridge must not collapse.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.080
I'll make sure the stitches
are clearly visible.
