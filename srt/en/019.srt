1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,880
Ensure the left and right sleeves are not
mixed up, and verify the sleeve attachment

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,520
measurements on the body and
the sleeve from the front.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,840
Wrap the sleeves within the body piece
and align them right sides together.

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,560
Examine the sleeve fabric
and attach the sleeve.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
Pin the sleeve cap to the
side seam of the body.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,880
Well.

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,720
Next, align the sleeve attachment
points and secure them with pins.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,240
At this point, pin the body piece
to the folded mountain edge.

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,840
Place a pin 5 centimetres above the sleeve
attachment point, aligned with

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,320
the 5-millimetre seam allowance.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,880
Continue to place pins at 5cm intervals.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,720
Similarly, place a pin at
the beginning of the month.

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,560
Sleeve attachment. First, remove the
basting pins and use a small needle

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,600
to take a small horizontal stitch.

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,520
I shall stop.

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,480
Next, we perform the scoop stop.

17
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,760
When starting to attach,
sew with a 2.5 cm hem.

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,240
Sew up to one stitch before
the end and remove the needle.

19
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,760
Sew the outer mountain with a
three-and-a-half-stitch backstitch.

20
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,800
Sew the other side in the same manner,
then remove the needle 2cm from the

21
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,240
end and sew back along the same path.

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,560
The sleeve attachment shall
be secured with a slip stitch.

23
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,400
That completes the external connection.

24
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,640
In this manner, the body side
is stitched with shallow folds.

25
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,480
Place the flat iron on the outside.

26
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,480
A 2-millimetre restriction will
be applied to the sleeve side.

27
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
Turn up the sleeves.

28
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,440
Trim the 2mm ridge and
finish with a finishing tool.

29
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,480
Next, fold the lower edge of
the kuke-dai as indicated.

30
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,760
At this point, please take care to include
the seam allowance under the

31
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,520
sleeve within the front sleeve.

32
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,240
Turn the swing side out and neaten
the sleeve attachment seam allowance.

33
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,720
First, attach three pin tacks
centred on the sleeve cap.

34
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,200
Next, pin the underarm gusset in
place to prevent it from bunching up.

35
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,400
Pin the sleeve to the sleeve stop.

36
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,880
Next, attach the ear 3
centimetres above the sleeve stop.

37
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,680
Attach one stitch to
the sleeve hem as well.

38
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,080
Furthermore, within the 2mm seam allowance
at the underarm, the needle stitches

39
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,560
for the ear hair are visible.

40
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,960
In this manner, secure one stitch within
the 2mm seam allowance

41
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,560
of the underarm yoke.

42
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,120
The finishing iron is used to shape the
rounded underarm area of the furisode

43
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,960
sleeves, and to adjust the
cuffs and the kise mountain.
